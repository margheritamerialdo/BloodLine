# BloodLine
This repository contains the code for my bachelor's degree project, which was developed as part of the "Languages and Technologies for the Web" exam within the Computer Science &amp; Control Engineering course at Sapienza University. The project was a collaborative effort with my colleague Luca Vitaterna.

#Technologies Used
The project is built using the following technologies:

HTML: Used for creating the structure and content of web pages.

CSS: Used for styling the web pages and ensuring a visually appealing user interface.

JavaScript: Utilized for implementing client-side functionality and enhancing user interactivity.

PHP: Used for server-side scripting and interacting with databases.

Bootstrap: A popular front-end framework for designing responsive and mobile-first web pages.

AJAX: Implemented for making asynchronous requests to the server and dynamically updating the content without page refresh.

SQL (PostgreSQL): Utilized to create and manage the database for storing application data.
